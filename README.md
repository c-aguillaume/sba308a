Going to create a website that has information about the Characters in Harry Potter which is arguably one of the best stories via books and movies I''ve raed and watched in my whole life.

Base URL: https://api.potterdb.com/

The plan is to make cards for each character. I will start with 5 cards.
On the card I want included :
<br>Name:
<br>Blood status:
<br>Image:
<br>wand:
<br>wiki link to wiki page for this character:

        I originally started with the above but after realizing the data set was incomplete I changed to the following:

        <br>Name:
        <br>Gender
        <br>Eye Color
        <br>Image:
        <br>wand:
        <br>wiki link to wiki page for this character:

To help I used a few online turorials to help me get a step by step of what I should do. I coded everything myself.
